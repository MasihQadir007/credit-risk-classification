# Credit Risk Classification Model

This repository contains code for a machine learning model designed to predict loan risk based on financial information. The model is intended to aid in assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers by predicting the likelihood of loan default.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of categorizing loans into two groups: healthy loans and high-risk loans. The dataset used for training and evaluation includes various financial features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, and derogatory marks. The target variable is the loan status, where 0 represents healthy loans and 1 represents high-risk loans.

## Contents

- `lending_data.csv`: Dataset containing historical lending activity, including features and loan status.
- `loan_risk_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.



## Model Evaluation

The primary evaluation metrics used for assessing the model's performance include accuracy, precision, and recall. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify loans as healthy or high-risk.

## Conclusion

The developed model offers a reliable solution for predicting loan risk based on the provided financial information. By accurately assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers, the model can assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions and mitigating the risk of loan default.
